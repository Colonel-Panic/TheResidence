THE BIG IDEA-
After college, Eric, Evan, Jack, maybe some others, will move out to a booming city for young people, and get a large
apartment, that will be made so awesome, it will get it's own name- TheResidence. All one word. Evan, Jack, maybe some 
others, will be involved in some sort of tech start-up(funded by Venture Capital), while Eric is off chillin' in the 
political world. And of course, there will be cats.
THE CITIES-
Currently, the cities being considered are:
  -Seattle, Washington
  -Berkeley, California
  -San Francisco, California
  -Portland, Oregon
TRANSPORTATION-
As a group, we will collectively own a single car, hybrid or electric. Jack & Eric will ride bikes as their main
source of transportation, and Evan & maybe some others, can do whatever the hell they want. However, the car will be 
and not often used as an individual form of transportation. Residents will each have a personal method of transportation 
such as a bicycle, or motor scooter.
TECHNOLOGY-
We would have a couple of shared "Home" computers, most likely iMacs, Mac Minis or Mac Pros. Everyone would have at least 
one laptop, possibly two, if work and personal were being kept seperate- based on personal preference.
